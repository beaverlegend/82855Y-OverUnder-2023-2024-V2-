# 82855Y – Over Under Code

This repo contains the PROS code used for Team 82855Y during the **Over Under** season. This was my first year coding, so the project focuses on basic structure, simple subsystems and getting the robot to run consistent driver and auton routines.

## Robot Overview

The robot included:

* Basic tank/arcade drive
* Intake + launcher systems
* Simple autonomous routines
* Controller bindings for match and skills

> **Robot Image Placeholder:**
> `![Robot](path/to/image.png)`

## Project Structure

* `/src` – Main robot code
* `/include` – Headers, configs, and globals
* `main.cpp` – Driver control and main loop
* Auton files for side-specific routines

## Features

* Basic drive control
* Intake + launcher code
* Early auton structure
* Simple macros for driver control

## How to Use

1. Install PROS
2. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourname/82855Y.git
   ```
3. Open the folder in VSCode
4. Set motor ports in `config.hpp`
5. Build:

   ```bash
   pros make
   ```
6. Upload:

   ```bash
   pros mu
   ```

## Notes

* Code is from my first year programming, so it’s simple but functional.
* Good reference if you’re looking at how my later 82855S/G code evolved.
